Trivia Game
- This is an app that engages a user to answer 5 trivia questions correctly before the timer runs out.

- When the page is loaded, a splash screen will be visible with the name of the game, some instructions, and a button labeled start game.

- Immiediately when the button is clicked, the splash screen will disappear, the questions will be listed, and a timer will be visible, and will start counting down.

- Below each question, there are a group of answers, each with a radio button. The user will use the radio buttons as input, and will hit a submit button when finished.

- If any questions were left unanswered, it will submit anyways. If the timer reaches 0 then the game will end and all the answers will be submitted.

- In the final screen of the app, the results will be listed. There will be a stat for questions answered correctly, incorrectly, and unanswered.
